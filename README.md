Get financial data out of German annual reports into a machine readable format

This is a problem that has really annoyed me in the last years. I now commited and will resolve it as good as possible.

Current roadmap:
1. Figure out how to find the page numbers of the financial statement in most of the cases.
2. Idk, read the tables with tabula or camelot. I will figure it out when I will be here.

Any ideas or wanting to help? Just contact me at szymonnastaly (at) gmail . com
